I'm a web developer passionate about making programming knowledge accessible to all and improving my skillset day by day

When I'm not coding, you can find me trying to catch up on a list of SNES games that I never got to play as a kid :video_game:


   
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on The Odin Project
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Web Development
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: jeffreyally@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy cooking a lot, and Taco Bell when my stove needs a break
